title: Rewriting logic
---

The theory and applications of rewriting logic have been vigorously
developed by researchers all over the world during the past years, with
more than three hundred papers related to rewriting logic published so
far (see the [roadmap](publications.md)).

International workshops on rewriting logic have been held in
[Luxembourg (2024)](https://wrla2024.gitlab.io/),
[Germany (2022)](http://sv.postech.ac.kr/wrla2022/),
[Ireland (2020)](https://wrla2020.webs.upv.es/),
[Greece (2018)](https://project.inria.fr/wrla18/),

and [United States (1996)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710661/4).
Next workshop will take place
in [Turin, Italy (2026)](https://wrla2026.github.io/).

Several journal special issues have been published on rewriting logic:
[JLAMP 134 (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/special-issue/10HT7LGD2SQ),
[JLAMP 110 (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming/special-issue/10R8T94S8FM),

[HOSC 20 (2007)](https://link.springer.com/journal/10990/20/1/page/1),
and [TCS 285 (2002)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/theoretical-computer-science/vol/285/issue/2).

Furthermore, several language implementations of rewriting logic
([CafeOBJ](https://cafeobj.org/),
[ELAN](https://web.archive.org/web/20210612151132/https://elan.loria.fr/), [Maude](index.md),
etc.) and a variety of [formal tools](tools.md) have also
been developed and have been used in a wide range of applications. You
may take a look to the [retrospective on rewrite engines published in TACAS 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_6).

Several snapshots of the state of rewriting logic research—some more
global in scope, and others restricted to specific areas such as
concurrency or object-based systems—have appeared so far
[IJCAR\'22](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10769-6_31),
[JLAMP\'20](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2019.100497),
[WoLLIC\'18](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-57669-4_2),
[JLAMP\'12](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlap.2012.06.003),
[TCS\'02](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/papers/abstract/MMroadmap_2001.html),
[FMOODS\'00](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-35520-7_5),

[Marktoberdorf\'98](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/papers/abstract/Mdirections_1998.html),
and [CONCUR\'96](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-61604-7_64).

Maude should be seen as our contribution to the broader collective
effort of building good language implementations for rewriting logic. In
this regard, a key distinguishing feature of Maude is its systematic and
efficient use of *reflection*, exploiting the
fact that rewriting logic is reflective, a feature that makes Maude
remarkably extensible and powerful, and that allows many advanced
metaprogramming and metalanguage applications.

Several versions of Maude have also been presented in different venues:
[IJCAR\'22](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10769-6_31),
[IJCAR\'16](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-40229-1_13),
[RTA\'11](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.RTA.2011.31),
[RTA\'04](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02348-4_27),
[RTA\'03](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-44881-0_7),
[WRLA\'00](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80137-9),
and [RTA\'99](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-48685-2_18).
An account of the history of the language may be found in the [Two Decades of Maude](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23165-5_11) 2015 paper.
Some more recent papers have focused on specific aspects of the language:
[strategies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2023.100887),
[symbolic features](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-10769-6_31).
